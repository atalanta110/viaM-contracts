## Attributions

Much of the codebase used in previously deployed contracts (no longer in use) is modified from existing works, including:

[Compound](https://compound.finance) - Jumping off point for token code and governance

[Synthetix](https://synthetix.io) - Rewards staking contract

[YEarn](https://yearn.finance)/[YFI](https://ygov.finance) - Initial fair distribution implementation

## Developer notes

- The versions of truffle, truffle-upgrades, openzeppelin contracts, etc. in package.json and lock file versions were changing during the timeframe of project development.
  E.g. OpenZeppelin ERC20Upgradeable contract was patched manually when name() and symbol() missed the 'virtual' specifier, that was added at version 3.4 but did not exist when one of the contracts was created in this repository. Solidity compiler version was set to 0.8.0 in recent openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable releases and it is recommended to use more updated versions of packages.

- The migration list is already long here, next updates would create new migrations lineup, stashing previous (current) state in a subfolder to keep code conveniently available.
